# Python-Programming-MOOC-2025

Progress in the **Python Programming MOOC 2025** course from the University of Helsinki MOOC.fi. This course teaches the fundamentals of programming in Python, covering both an **Introduction to Programming** and an **Advanced Course in Programming**, and includes practical exercises and projects.

This repository contains my progress in the **Python Programming MOOC 2025** course from the University of Helsinki. The course covers the basics of programming and advanced object‑oriented and functional programming concepts using Python, and includes hands‑on exercises and larger projects.

## Description

The course is part of the massive open online course (MOOC) series from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. It consists of two separate 5 ECTS courses:

* **Introduction to Programming**: Parts 1–7
* **Advanced Course in Programming**: Parts 8–14

To pass each course, you must complete the programming exercises and participate in the corresponding exam. The course materials are freely available online and the course runs from January 13, 2025 until the end of 2025 ([programming-25.mooc.fi][1]).

## Repository Contents

* **`exercises/`**: Solutions to the course’s practical exercise sets for each part.
* **`projects/`**: Larger projects that integrate multiple course topics into cohesive applications.
* **`README.md`**: This file, outlining the course structure and contents.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to **document my learning journey** in Python as I complete both the introductory and advanced courses. It serves as a reference for myself and for anyone interested in following the Python Programming MOOC curriculum.
